\gfsyntax{
   label fact \ARG{sym};\\
   label fact \ARG{sym} = \ARG{label};
}

\gfdescription{
   Allows us to ``name" proof lines with desired {\GF} symbols.
   We will then be able to refer to the proof line with {\em sym} rather
   than with its ``hook" ({\em label}). 
   In the first form the next asserted proof line will get the name \ARG{sym}. 
   In the second form the proof line whose label is {\em label} gets
   the alternative name \ARG{sym}.
}

\gfrecap{
Names a proof line with a GETFOL symbol.
Named proof lines can be accessed through its name.
In the first form the next asserted proof line will get the name `sym'.
In the second form the proof line whose label is `label' gets the
alternative name `sym'
