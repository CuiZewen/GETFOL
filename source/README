                                README

This README file describes the contents of the *source* directory of the GETFOL
distribution package. This directory has the following contents:

  README      :  this file.

  admin       :  source code of the ADMIN module (administration commands)

  context     :  source code of the CONTEXT module (multi-contextual reasoning)

  decide      :  source code of the DECIDE module (deciders)

  eval        :  source code of the EVAL module (syntactic evaluation, semantic
                 attachment)

  fix.gfl     :  file loaded at startup by GETFOL; it contains last-minute
                 changes of the code

  hgkm        :  source code of the hgkm interpreted language

  language    :  source code of the LANGUAGE module (declaration of the
                 language)

  meta        :  source code of the META module (metareasoning)

  nd          :  source code of the ND module (natural deduction inference
                 rules)

  parser      :  source code of the PARSER module (the reader of GETFOL)

  proof       :  source code of the PROOF module (handling of multiple proofs)

  rules       :  source code of the RULE module (cut, weaken, etc.)


                               * IMPORTANT NOTES *

The name of source files is given according to the following patterns:

  <module name>.cfg     configuration file for the module
  i<name>.fol           initialization file
  cmd<name>.fol         command file
  <name>.fol            high level functions
  <name>.hgk            low level functions
  <name>.rp             read and parsing functions
  v<name>.cl            declaration of special variables

The system can be configured at the module level also:

 * edit the configuration file to change the directory in which source and/or
   object files are to be stored/retrieved.

 * edit the initialization file to change the name of the commands and/or to
   eliminate some of the commands defined in a module.
   For instance, if you do not want to have the SUBSTitution rule, comment the
   lines:

     (mknewcommand (QUOTE SUBST) (QUOTE FOL)
                   (QUOTE Natural-Deduction)(QUOTE SUBST#) MTL)

   in the file "ind.cfg" before building the system.


If you find any bug, or want to add extensions to the system once it has been
built, you may want to edit the file "fix.gfl".
The file "fix.gfl" is loaded every time the system is started and therefore is a
good place where to put temporary patches/extensions to the code.


If you have find any bug or have suggestions on how to improve the system,
please send e-mail to:

               getfol@frege.mrg.dist.unige.it (GETFOL manager)
