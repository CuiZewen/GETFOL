If a {\tt reflect} command is used when a context {\tt META} does not
exist the error produced is that the relevant fact can not be found.
The error message should say that {\tt META} does not exist.

\gap
The {\tt subst} command has problems distinguishing
proof line labels from numbers in equalities.

\gap
The {\tt label} command does not check for overlaps between
labels for proof lines, axioms and theories.
