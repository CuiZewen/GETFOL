\section{Administration}
\label{sec-adm}

The commands described in this section manipulate the proof checker but do
not modify  the ``logical'' state of the deduction or of the computation.
Among the other things, they can be used to give alternative names to proof lines,
to load {\HG} or {\GF} files, to insert comments in {\GF} files, to show the
logical/computational status of the system.
