                                   README

This README file describes the contents of the *tst* directory of the GETFOL 
distribution package. This directory has the following contents:

  README        :  this file.
  LONGTEST      :  file to be fetched in order to test the system.
                   Fetching this file takes a long time.
  TEST          :  file to be fetched in order to test the system.
                   Fetching this file takes less time than the LONGTEST, but
                   it does not perform tests on sorts.
  LONGOUTPUT    :  output obtained by fetching in GETFOL the file LONGTEST.
  OUTPUT        :  output obtained by fetching in GETFOL the file TEST.

  decide        :  directory containing files to be fetched in order to test
                   the DECIDE module.
  eval          :  directory containing files to be fetched in order to test
                   the EVAL module.
  io            :  directory containing files to be fetched in order to test
                   the I/O of the system.
  lang          :  directory containing files to be fetched in order to test
                   the LANGUAGE module. 
  meta          :  directory containing files to be fetched in order to test 
                   the META module.
  nd            :  directory containing files to be fetched in order to test
                   the Natural-Deduction module.
  proof         :  directory containing files to be fetched in order to test 
                   the PROOF module.
  sort          :  directory containing files to be fetched in order to test
                   the sorts.
 

                         *** TESTING THE SYSTEM ***

The testing procedure is the following: go in the <getfol-dir>/tst directory,
and run the saved executable image making sure that the output can be saved to
a file. For instance, run the test into an emacs buffer, or use the tee unix
command to make a copy of the output on a file, e.g. 

     % ../make/getfol | tee /tmp/output.tst
     > (SYSBOOT)
     ...

Then fetch the file LONGTEST (TEST):

     GETFOL:: fetch LONGTEST;
     ...

The system will load several test files, until it finishes (message "I am
finished fetching LONGTEST") or until an error occurs (message "Error while
fetching file XXX").

If no error occurs the trace of the test should be the equal to the content of
the file LONGOUTPUT (OUTPUT).
