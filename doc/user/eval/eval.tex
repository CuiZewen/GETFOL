\gfsyntax{
  eval \ARG{wff} \ALT \ARG{fact} \ALT \ARG{term} \OPT{by \ARG{simpexpr}};
}

\gfdescription{
  This command evaluates the expression (\ARG{wff}, the wff of \ARG{fact}
  or \ARG{term} respectively) by combining the semantic evaluation of the
  expression in the simulation structure and the syntactical rewriting
  performed by using the union of the rewrite rules indicated by 
  \ARG{simpexpr}.
}

   ***** declare indconst a b c;
   ***** decrep REP;
   ***** attach a dar [REP]a;
   a attached to 'a
   a is the preferred name of a
   ***** attach b dar [REP]b;
   b attached to 'b
   b is the preferred name of b
   ***** attach c dar [REP]c;
   c attached to 'c
   c is the preferred name of c
   ***** declare funconst G 2;
   ***** declare indvar x y;
   ***** setbasicsimp S at wffs {forall x y.G(x y)=x};
   ***** declare predconst P 1;
   ***** DEFLAM P(x) (IF (EQ x (QUOTE a)) TRUE 
                         (IF (EQ x (QUOTE b)) FALSE 
                          (QUOTE UNDEF&)));
   ***** attach P to [REP]P;
   P attached to P
   ***** eval P(G(a,G(b,c))) by S;
   1   P(G(a,G(b,c)))     
   ***** eval P(G(b,c)) and P(c) by S;
   2   not (P(G(b,c)) and P(c))
   ***** eval P(G(c,a)) by S;
   3   P(G(c,a)) iff P(c)   
   ***** eval forall x.P(G(x x)) by S;
   4   forall x. P(G(x,x)) iff forall x. P(x)     
   ***** extension UNIVERSAL by {a b c};
   Now the extension of UNIVERSAL is fixed to be : (a b c)
   ***** eval forall x.P(G(x x)) by S;
   5   not forall x. P(G(x,x))

\gfnotes{
  In the case of sorts with extensions (see the command {\tt extension} in section 
  \ref{sec-sort}) quantification is considered as  {\bf bounded quantification}.
  In other words, let $P$ be a predicate and $x$ an indvar of sort $S$, where
  $S$ has extension $\{s_1,\ldots,s_n\}$.
  Then the following equivalences hold:
  $$ 
  \forall x(P(x)\liff P(s_1) \con \ldots P(s_n))
  $$
  $$
  \exists x(P(x)\liff P(s_1) \dis \ldots P(s_n))
  $$
  %
  The command explicitly unfolds universal/existential statements into 
  their propositional equivalents. The expansion is performed 
  syntactically, that is the formula $\forall x P(x)$ [$\exists x P(x)$]
  is rewritten as $P(s_1) \con \ldots \con P(s_n)$
  [$P(s_1) \dis \ldots \dis P(s_n)$].
  The expansion mechanism embedded in {\tt simplify} is not used by {\tt eval}.
