\section{Equality rules}

We describe here the rules for substitution of equality, $sub_l$ and $sub_r$.
{\GF} does not have explicit axioms or rules for reflexivity, commutativity and
transitivity.
Commutativity and transitivity, however, can be derived by $sub_l$ and $sub_r$,
and symmetry can be derived by using other {\GF} commands (for instance by
semantic simplification (see section \ref{sec-eval}), by the tautology and
monadic deciders (see the commands {\tt tauteq} and {\tt monadeq} commands in
section \ref{sec-decide}).


\[
\begin{array}{|c|c||c|c|} \hline 
	&&& \\
	sub_l &
	\fraz{A(t_1) \ \ \ \ t_1 = t_2}
	     {A(t_2)}
	&
	sub_r &
	\fraz{A(t_1) \ \ \ \ t_2 = t_1}
	     {A(t_2)}
	\\
	&&& \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]
