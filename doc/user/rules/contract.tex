\gfsyntax{
	contract \ALT ctc  \ARG{fact} by \ARG{assumption1} \SEQ  \ARG{assumptionN}; 
}

\gfdescription{
	Every \ARG{assumptionI} must occur in the list of dependencies of \ARG{fact}.

	The proof line's dependencies are those of \ARG{fact} less all the dependencies 
	with the same wff of some \ARG{assumptionI}s.
}

\gfrecap{
	Every `assumptionI' must occur in the list of dependencies of `fact'.

	The proof line's dependencies are those of `fact' less all the dependencies 
	with the same wff of some `assumptionI's.
}

   ***** declare sentconst A B C D;
   ***** assume A A A A B B C D;
   1   A     (1)
   2   A     (2)
   3   A     (3)
   4   A     (4)
   5   B     (5)
   6   B     (6)
   7   C     (7)
   8   D     (8)
   ***** wk 8 by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7;
   9   D     (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
   ***** ctc 9 by 1 5;
   10   D     (1 5 7 8)
   ***** ctc 9 by 1 2 3 5 7;
   11   D     (1 2 3 5 7 8)
   ***** ctc 9 by 10;
   I can only contract facts which occur in the assumption list!
   ***** ctc 11 by 4;
   I cannot contract using a fact not occurring in the assumption list!
