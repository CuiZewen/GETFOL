   ***** show whereami;
   You are now using an unnamed context.
   You are now using an unnamed proof.
   ***** nameproof P1;
   You have named the current proof: P1
   ***** show whereami;
   You are now using an unnamed context.

   ***** declare sentconst A;
   ***** assume A;
   1   A     (1)
   ***** makeproof P2;
   You have created the empty proof: P2
   ***** switchproof P2;
   You are now using the proof: P2
   ***** declare sentconst B;
