\gfexample+
   ***** declare predconst P1 1;
   P1 has been declared to be a Predconst

   ***** declare sort P2 ;
   P2 has been declared to be a sort

   ***** mostgeneral P1;
   The unary predconst P1 has been declared to be a sort
   P1 is now equivalent to UNIVERSAL

   ***** mostgeneral P2;
   P2 is a sort
   P2 is now equivalent to UNIVERSAL
+

\gfnotes{
  \ARG{sym} has to be either an unused symbol or a sort or a unary predicate.
  The new symbol does not substitute for the default most general sort {\tt
  UNIVERSAL}; it is defined to be equivalent to it.
}
