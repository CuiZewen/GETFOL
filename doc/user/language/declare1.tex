\gfdescription{
   This commands adds new symbols to the {\GF} language.
   The user can declare primitive symbols belonging to the following
   categories: {\tt sentpar}, {\tt sentconst}, {\tt indvar}, {\tt indpar},
   {\tt indconst}, {\tt funpar}, {\tt funconst}, {\tt predpar}, 
   {\tt predconst}.
   The user can specify binding priorities ($prbp$, $lbp$, $rbp$) 
   for the operator symbols being declared.
   If this is not done, then the default priorities are used
   (see section \ref{sec-log-symb}).
}

\gfrecap{
Adds new symbols to the GETFOL language.

   ***** comment ! declarations of the first kind !

   ***** declare sentconst A B C;
   A has been declared to be a Sentconst
   B has been declared to be a Sentconst
   C has been declared to be a Sentconst

   ***** declare sentpar S1 S2;
   S1 has been declared to be a Sentpar
   S2 has been declared to be a Sentpar

   ***** declare indvar x y;
   UNIVERSAL is a sort
   x has been declared to be an Indvar
   y has been declared to be an Indvar

   ***** declare indpar a;
   UNIVERSAL is a sort
   a has been declared to be an Indpar

   ***** declare indconst alpha;
   UNIVERSAL is a sort
   alpha has been declared to be an Indconst

   ***** declare funpar g3 2 [inf];
   g3 has been declared to be a Funpar

\gfnotes{
   Since the {\GF} logic is sorted, the user can specify sort
   information for some categories of symbols. If this is not done, then the
   default information is used (as is the case in the examples above).
   The sorting mechanism in {\GF} is discussed in section \ref{sec-sort}.
