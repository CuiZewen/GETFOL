\gfcommand{hardware}{semantic attachment to values of a s-expression}
\index{hardware}

\gfsyntax{
  hardware \ARG{indconst} to \ALT dar \ARG{sexpr};\\
  hardware \ARG{indconst} to \ALT dar [ \ARG{rep} ] \ARG{sexpr};
}

\gfdescription{
  This command is similar to the attach command for \ARG{indconst}.
  The difference is that, if \ARG{sexpr} changes value over time, then so does
  the value of the attachment.
  It is a "dynamic attachment" in the sense that it is attached to the values the
  \ARG{sexpr} assumes over time.

   ***** declare indconst clock t0 t1;
   ***** attach t0 to 0;
   t0 attached to '0
   ***** attach t1 to 1;
   t1 attached to '1
   ***** hardware clock to time;
   clock attached to time

   Hi!  Glad your back.  What would you like to talk about now?
   ***** simplify clock = t0;
   1   clock = t0     
   ***** done;
   >(SETQ time 1)
   1
   >(GETFOL)
   Hi!  Glad your back.  What would you like to talk about now?
   ***** simplify clock = t1;
   2   clock = t1
