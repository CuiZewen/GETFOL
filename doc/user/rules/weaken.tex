\gfdescription{
	Each \ARG{factI} can be an assumption or, more generally, a fact.
	In the first case, the derived fact depends on the dependencies of 
	\ARG{fact} plus those of \ARG{factI}.
	In the second case, the dependencies of the \ARG{factI} are added to the
	list of dependencies of \ARG{fact}.
