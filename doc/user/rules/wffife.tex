If \ARG{fact1}'s wff is {\tt wffif A then B else C} and \ARG{fact2}'s wff is
{\tt A}, then the derived wff is {\tt B} and its dependencies are the union of
those of \ARG{fact1} and \ARG{fact2}.

If the wff of `fact1' is `wffif A then B else C' and the wff of `fact2' is
`A', then the derived wff is `B' and its dependencies are the union of those of
`fact1' and `fact2'.
