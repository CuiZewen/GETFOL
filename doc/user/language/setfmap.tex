\gfcommand{setfmap}{adds another fmap to a funsym}
\index{setfmap}

\gfsyntax{
  setfmap \ARG{funsym} ( \ARG{sym1} \SEQ \ARG{symN} ) = \ARG{sym};
}

\gfdescription{
  The command adds (\ARG{sym1} \SEQ \ARG{symN} \ARG{sym}) to the fmaps of
  \ARG{funsym}.
}

\gfrecap{
Adds (`sym1', ..., `symN', `sym') to the fmaps of `funsym'
}

\gfexample+
   ***** declare predconst S4 1;
   S4 has been declared to be a Predconst

   ***** declare indvar x [S1];
   S1 is a sort
   x has been declared to be an Indvar

   ***** declare funconst f ( S4 S5 ) = S1;
   S1 is a sort
   The unary predconst S4 has been declared to be a sort
   S5 has been declared to be a sort
   f has been declared to be a Funconst
   
   ***** show sym f;
   f is declared to be a Funconst of arity 2.
   The FMAPs for f are
      UNIVERSAL * UNIVERSAL ==> UNIVERSAL,
      S4        * S5        ==> S1.

   ***** setfmap f ( S1 S6 ) = S5;
   S5 is a sort
   S1 is a sort
   S6 has been declared to be a sort

   ***** show sym f;
   f is declared to be a Funconst of arity 2.
   The FMAPs for f are
      S1        * S6        ==> S5,
      UNIVERSAL * UNIVERSAL ==> UNIVERSAL,
      S4        * S5        ==> S1.

\gfnotes{
  Note that \ARG{funsym} must have been previously declared to be a {\tt
  funsym}. 
  Its arity must be {\em N}.
