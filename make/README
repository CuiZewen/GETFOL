								   README

This README file describes the contents of the *make* directory of the GETFOL 
distribution package. This directory has the following contents:

  README        :  this file.
 
  TROUBLES.DOC  :  a list of the most common problems encountered during the
                   installation procedure.
                   Read this file if you have problems building the system.

  getfol.cfg    :  configuration file for GETFOL.
                   This file may be edited to change the modules that are to be
                   installed in the GETFOL system.

  hgkm.cfg      :  configuration file for HGKM.

  host.lsp      :  common lisp code, which stores the host-dependent
                   informations needed to build the GETFOL system.

  install.lsp   :  common lisp code, which defines the functions needed to build
                   the GETFOL system.


                         *** BUILDING THE SYSTEM ***

0) [optional] edit the file "getfol.cfg" to determine what the modules to
   be installed are.
   For instance, if you do not want to install the META module, comment the
   following two lines in the file "getfol.cfg":

      (LOAD (PATH-CONCAT (SYS-GET-SRCDIR 'GETFOL)  "meta"      "meta.cfg"))
      (SYS-ADD-MODULE  'GETFOL  'META)

1) edit the file "host.lsp" changing the value of the variable %HOME-DIR% to
   the pathname of the GETFOL directory in your system.
   That, is, suppose your current directory is the *make* directory of the
   GETFOL system:

      $ pwd
      /home/goedel/staff/john/getfol/make

   Edit the file "host.lsp" and change the line:

      (SETQ %HOME-DIR% "/home/tarski/staff/getfol/getfol-v20")

   to:

      (SETQ %HOME-DIR% "/home/goedel/staff/john/getfol")

2) call your favorite lisp environment and type at the prompt:

        > (LOAD "install.lsp")
        > (MAKE-GETFOL)
        > (SYSTEM-SAVE "GETFOL")

   This will create an executable file (in the example GETFOL) in the
   directory make.


If you have any problem making the system, please send e-mail to:

               getfol@frege.mrg.dist.unige.it (GETFOL manager)
